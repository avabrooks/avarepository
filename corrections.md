## MCQ Corrections:
* **10**: printSome Method
     * for the output to be " 0 10 " the expression i % num2  and i % 2 has to equal 0. This can only happen in the values from 0 to 19, not 0 to 9. Since they are both divisible by 5 and even, " 0 10 " will be printed. Only 0 would be printed if 10, 5 was inputted rather than the correct answer of 20,5. 
* **13**: Boolean expression with a, b, and c
     * Need to use DeMorgan's Law!!!
     * !(a && b) = !a || !b thus !a || !b || c
* **19**: sum array elements
*
