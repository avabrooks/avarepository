## Week 5: Goals -> [ticket](https://github.com/avabrooks/swagketo/issues/4)

* Templating:
   * Being in charge of design and templates, my goal is to create an overall color scheme and uniformity within the site. By implementing sassy and bootstrap, whenever other people add files to the repository then the overall format will stay uniform to the site.
   * Finish fragments:
     * Add new nav bar - potentially floating 
 * User Interaction:
   * For this week I want to start creating the 'easier' pages that can likely be pulled from other projects(sign up, login, etc).
   * A main part of this project is the profile page and being able to customize your profile
     * I have worked with some profile customization in the past, but getting a template and working with backend to save new changes to the database is something I want to focus on as well
     * I also want to create two separate profile templates for an admin user vs a student user with the varying features available


* Timeline:
  * **Monday:**
     Focused on group planning with Risa(many people absent in our group)and established our personal goals that will work into PBL. Also emailed sponser to ask if he had thought of any more concept ideas or features that he would want our website to have
  * **Tuesday:**
     Organized goals onto personal github pages. Started [commiting](https://github.com/avabrooks/swagketo/commits/master) with work on index, layouts, and sassy
  * **Wednesday:**
     Start and finish nav bar with new design. See if sponser emailed back before finalizing nav bar and features. 
  * **Thursday:**
     Finish logo and design/overall layouts for all templates. Watch AP Video #1
  * **Friday:**
     Finish all tasks on [ticket](https://github.com/avabrooks/swagketo/issues/4)/catchup day to complete all goals for this week. Watch AP Video #2. Start profile pages, can create mockups with group/sponsor to ensure the design is user friendly and desirable. 
     
* **Coding Reflection:**
  This week my plans changed a bit. With the addition of the 2 college board videos I shifted my inclass work and outside work. I completed all of my large tasks like the nav bar, overall styling, and starting to create templates. I would have liked to get more functionality on the templates, but with multiple people in our group gone this week it was harder to collaborate as we got back into the swing of PBL work. This next week I feel as though I know how to balance teh two AP daily videos along with PBL work. I should have set more team goals with other people who are working on differnt roles, however I completed my individual roles suffiecently.
