## Week 5: Goals -> [ticket](https://github.com/avabrooks/swagketo/issues/4)

* Templating:
   * Being in charge of design and templates, my goal is to create an overall color scheme and uniformity within the site. By implementing sassy and bootstrap, whenever other people add files to the repository then the overall format will stay uniform to the site.
   * Finish fragments:
     * Add new nav bar - potentially floating 
 * User Interaction:
   * For this week I want to start creating the 'easier' pages that can likely be pulled from other projects(sign up, login, etc).
   * A main part of this project is the profile page and being able to customize your profile
     * I have worked with some profile customization in the past, but getting a template and working with backend to save new changes to the database is something I want to focus on as well
     * I also want to create two separate profile templates for an admin user vs a student user with the varying features available
